##Listing Page

####1. Un-prioritized content & Cluttered UI
Design elements to be prioritized

- Search
- Listings
- Post RFQ
- Refine Search
- Premium Membership
- Tradeshows & Exhibitions
- Ads
- Featured Products
- Featured Partners

####2. Discontinuous user flow & visibility issues

- Post RFQ is redundant CTA, send inquired should be sufficient. Also eats up very valuable real-state

- Breadcrumbs do give user a sense of which category it is but a dedicated space should be given when category name (possible some banner) should be showcased.

- As soon as user navigates to a category page, not finding a dedicated category drop-down hampers usability. List in refine search cannot not and must not search that purpose. Dedicated category list down those be on every category page. 

- In-consistent design language (explained below) makes it difficult for user to differentiate between link and text.

- Single listing on a category page consists of following:
	- Product Image
	- Name
	- Supplier Name
	- Variables
		- Min Order
		- Quantity
		- Shipping Cost
		- Price
		- Samples Available
		- Product Status
		- Delivery Time
		- Payment Mode
	- Description
	- Category
	- Keywords
	- Legends/Icons
		- Verified member
		- Priority member
		- Membership year
		- Country
		- Business Type
		- Product viewed
	- Call to Action
		- Send Inquiry
		- Get Latest Price

- Points to consider
	- Consistent design language
	- Better pictorial representation
	- Tabulated specifications
	- Distinctive categories and keywords
	- Emphasis on following Call to Actions (seems redundant though)
	- Easy sharing
	- Redesign & better position legends
