#Analysis

As part of the first phase, this page enlists UX issues on each template.

## Home Page

###Design & Usability Issues
	
####1. View port under-utilization
Current layout is boxed instead of fluid. It makes use of 990px, if we consider a modest resolution of 1280 x 800 (what most 13-inch device feature), around 22% of the real state is still unused.

####2. Not mobile friendly
Tradebanq's primary target might not be mobile devices but that's not a reason good enough to score negative marks on SEO.
