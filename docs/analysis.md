#Analysis

As part of the first phase, this page enlists design and usability issues on each template.

## Home Page
	
####1. View port under-utilization
Current layout is boxed instead of fluid. It makes use of 990px, if we consider a modest resolution of 1280 x 800 (what most 13-inch device feature), around 22% of the real state is still unused.

####2. Not mobile friendly
Tradebanq's primary target might not be mobile devices but that's not a reason good enough to score negative marks on SEO.

####3. Un-prioritized content & cluttered UI
Content prioritization needed. How much real state a section gets will be dictates on this priority. Below list to be ranked:

####4. Inconsistent Design Language

	- Size
	- Readability
	- Hierarchy

####5. Call to Action

- Redundant calls to action
	- Register (3)
	- Login (2)
- CTA to button mapping missing

	- Non-existent breathing space 

##Listing Page

####1. [View port under-utilization (common for all templates)]()
####2. [Mobile-friendliness (common for all templates)]()
####3. Un-prioritized content & Cluttered UI
Design elements to be prioritized

- Search
- Listings
- Post RFQ
- Refine Search
- Premium Membership
- Tradeshows & Exhibitions
- Ads
- Featured Products
- Featured Partners

#####Discontinuous user flow & visibility issues

- Post RFQ is redundant CTA, send inquired should be sufficient. Also eats up very valuable real-state

- Breadcrumbs do give user a sense of which category it is but a dedicated space should be given when category name (possible some banner) should be showcased.

- As soon as user navigates to a category page, not finding a dedicated category drop-down hampers usability. List in refine search cannot not and must not search that purpose. Dedicated category list down those be on every category page. 

- In-consistent design language (explained below) makes it difficult for user to differentiate between link and text.

- Single listing on a category page consists of following:
	- Product Image
	- Name
	- Supplier Name
	- Variables
		- Min Order
		- Quantity
		- Shipping Cost
		- Price
		- Samples Available
		- Product Status
		- Delivery Time
		- Payment Mode
	- Description
	- Category
	- Keywords
	- Legends/Icons
		- Verified member
		- Priority member
		- Membership year
		- Country
		- Business Type
		- Product viewed
	- Call to Action
		- Send Inquiry
		- Get Latest Price

- Points to consider
	- Consistent design language
	- Better pictorial representation
	- Tabulated specifications
	- Distinctive categories and keywords
	- Emphasis on following Call to Actions (seems redundant though)
	- Easy sharing
	- Redesign & better position legends

##Description Page

####1. [View port under-utilization (common for all templates)]()
####2. [Mobile-friendliness (common for all templates)]()
####3. Un-prioritized content & Cluttered UI

Discontinuous user flow & visibility issues:

- When user visits a product page, most important thing appears to be the supplier name. Instead product name should be in the lime light where as Supplier name should be the info tied to product.

- Ads are awefully close to search and breadcrums. The urge to place them there is understandable but needs to be addressed.

- Thumbnail sized images used as main product images. This must be replaced with a purpose-oriented product gallery with ability to view full size images.

- Variables to be tabulated and better positioned

- Description & specifications appear to be free-form. A better approach would to be combine both in tabs thus ensuring structure & more real-state. A rough example would be to have three tabs i.e. Description, Specification & Supplier Profile.

- Call to actions seriously neglected. Possible CTAs for a product description page may be following (to be ranked and evaluate for redundancy):
	- Contact Supplier
	- Get latest price
	- Send inquiry
