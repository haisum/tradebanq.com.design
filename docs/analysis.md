#Analysis

As part of the first phase, this page enlists design and usability issues on each template.

###Common issues in each template
Each Template has following issues in common, it's only fitting to list them here:

####1. View port under-utilization
Current layout is boxed instead of fluid. It makes use of 990px, if we consider a modest resolution of 1280 x 800 (what most 13-inch device feature), around 22% of the real state is still unused.

####2. Not mobile friendly
Tradebanq's primary target might not be mobile devices but that's not a reason good enough to score negative marks on SEO.
