### Project cycle

We discussed how this project shall be pursued. Here are five phases of this project that shall be followed in sequence:

- In first phase (analysis) we will examine the website and identify places where we shall be looking for potential issues. 
- In requirements phase, Once potential places are identified we will for each place, define issues found and make a list. Management will be given a presentation on why we listed down these issues and why they need fix. Requirements might change after feedback from management.
- Once everybody agrees on requirements, we shall start pre-design phase and come up with wireframes which will be delivered and finalized by ideally mid or maximum by end of january.
- Project manager splits requirements and wireframes in sub tasks so individual developers could work on them and defines technical approach and constraints for performing them.
- Coding and testing starts

### Work environment

Meetings will be held for three hours in working days in a week and two full weekends of alternate weeks due to other work and job constraints.
