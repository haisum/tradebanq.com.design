##Details Page

####1. Un-prioritized content & Cluttered UI

Discontinuous user flow & visibility issues:

- When user visits a product page, most important thing appears to be the supplier name. Instead product name should be in the lime light where as Supplier name should be the info tied to product.

- Ads are awfully close to search and breadcrumbs. The urge to place them there is understandable but needs to be addressed.

- Thumbnail sized images used as main product images. This must be replaced with a purpose-oriented product gallery with ability to view full size images.

- Variables to be tabulated and better positioned

- Description & specifications appear to be free-form. A better approach would to be combine both in tabs thus ensuring structure & more real-state. A rough example would be to have three tabs i.e. Description, Specification & Supplier Profile.

- Call to actions seriously neglected. Possible CTAs for a product description page may be following (to be ranked and evaluate for redundancy):
	- Contact Supplier
	- Get latest price
	- Send inquiry
